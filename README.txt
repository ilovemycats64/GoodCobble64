How to modify the drops:

Method 1: Just edit the common config

Method 2: Creating a datapack
download "/src/main/resources", this will be your datapack
edit the loottables inside the data directory
select datapack during world creation or add it afterwards

Why would you want to create a datapack?
Since the datapack uses loottables, you can add things like recursive tables or weights to certain rolls.
